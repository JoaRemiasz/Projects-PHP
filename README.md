### Task 1: Login, Registration, Session

The task is to develop a user login and registration application. It consists of four stages:

- **Stage 1:** Create an attack-prone login application that uses a database and a login form.

- **Stage 2:** Improve the application by protecting it from attacks by converting special characters.

- **Stage 3:** Develop the application with a session mechanism, allowing users to remain logged in.

- **Stage 4:** Add the ability to register users to the database, including error handling and registration success.
