- **Stage 2:** Improve the application by protecting it from attacks by converting special characters.

- **Stage 3:** Develop the application with a session mechanism, allowing users to remain logged in.

- **Stage 4:** Add the ability to register users to the database, including error handling and registration success.


### Task 2: Geolocation, logging of portal visitor visits

- **Stage 2:** Creating a database with a "users" table to store user data.

- **Stage 3:** Adding a login function and logging logins and failed access attempts.

- **Stage 4:** Allowing users to create their directories, upload, download and delete files.

- **Stage 5:** Providing an intuitive interface for directory navigation and file management.

- **Stage 1:** Creation of an online discussion forum with access for guests and logged-in users.

- **Stage 2:** Guest privileges: browse topics, no ability to create topics or posts.

- **Stage 3:** Privileges of logged-in users: creating topics, adding posts, deleting own posts.

- **Stage 4:** Existence of a site admin with full access to all forum functions and content.

- **Stage 5:** Creation of a database with a "users" table for registered users.

- **Stage 6:** Using the curse word "damn" causes an error and blocks the posting.
