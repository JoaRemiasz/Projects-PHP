**Projects PHP:**

Task 1: Login, Registration, Session
The task is to develop a user login and registration application. It consists of four stages:
• The first stage is to create an attack-prone login application that uses a database and a login form.
• The second stage is to improve the application by protecting it from attacks by converting special characters.
• The third stage is to develop the application with a session mechanism, allowing users to remain logged in.
• The fourth stage is to add the ability to register users to the database, including error handling and registration success
