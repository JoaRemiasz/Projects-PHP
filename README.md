## Projects PHP:

### Task 1: Login, Registration, Session

The task is to develop a user login and registration application. It consists of four stages:

- **Stage 1:** Create an attack-prone login application that uses a database and a login form.

- **Stage 2:** Improve the application by protecting it from attacks by converting special characters.

- **Stage 3:** Develop the application with a session mechanism, allowing users to remain logged in.

- **Stage 4:** Add the ability to register users to the database, including error handling and registration success.


### Task 2: Geolocation, logging of portal visitor visits

The task consisted of:

- **Stage 1:** Testing the "netstat" command to obtain information about TCP network connections.

- **Stage 2:** Creating a "netstat.php" script to analyze network connections, also supporting other services.

- **Stage 3:** Testing various PHP functions, including functions related to DNS and geolocation data.

- **Stage 4:** Testing the operation of VPN and web application mining.

- **Stage 5:** Creating an application to collect information about users visiting the site and displaying this data.


### Task 3: Communicator

The task was to create an instant messaging application where registered users could send posts, files and messages among themselves. Key implementation steps were:

- **Stage 1:** Creating a database with three tables: "users" (to store user information), "guestportal" (with geolocation data of logged-in users) and "messages" (to store posts).

- **Stage 1:** Allowing logged-in users to add posts with text, files or both, and targeting specific audiences.

- **Stage 2:** Display user data in the menu and autocomplete the name in the post form.

- **Stage 3:** Support for different types of files (photos, video, audio) uploaded by users.

- **Stage 4:** Viewing of posts, both received and sent.

- **Stage 5:** Full access to all posts for the "admin" user.

- **Stage 6:** The application allows communication between users, content exchange and management, and provides geolocation information of users.
